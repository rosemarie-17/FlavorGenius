# FlavorGenius: Unleashing AI's Mastery in Flavor Discovery
## Project Overview
This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Amazon's 2023 Grocery and Gourmet Food reviews dataset to uncover emerging trends in healthy snacks, particularly for aging demographics. By combining review and metadata, we aim to support research and development (R&D) in identifying popular flavors, concepts, and market opportunities in the healthy snack industry.

## Objectives and Goals
* Analyze customer reviews to identify key themes and preferences.
* Use topic modeling to discover potential popular trends for aging demographics.
* Support R&D by providing data-driven insights into consumer preferences.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**
   * Merged review and metadata datasets using 'parent_asin' as the key.
   * Cleaned and preprocessed text data by removing stopwords and tokenizing.
2. **Topic Modeling:**
   * Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent topics and themes from the text data.
3. **Evaluation:**
   * Analyzed the extracted topics to align them with potential consumer trends.
   * Generated word clouds with popular terms for each topic
